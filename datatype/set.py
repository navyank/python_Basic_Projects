print(a)
# set are the collection of data of diffrent data type enclosed in curly brackets.(eg:{123,'viswa'})
# duplicate values are not allowed.(eg:abc two times will not print on sreen)
# unordered.(eg:the way which we code the set will not the same way print as output,that's why there is no indexing and slicing)
# immutable(eg:ones we write the code for a set it does not able to change the values in it)
# -------------
#  here print as {'viswa', 123, 'abc', 987.8}
